hci_power_control
	this function does variours differnt routines based ofn the hci_stack.state
	During the initilization of the HCI it(hci_stack.state == HCI_STATE_OFF)
		in the case that it is of and there is a switch on if the application want to power on or power off. In our case we want to power on so the hci_power_control_on() function is 
		called

		hci_power_control_on(): this used the information in the hci_stack.control. In our implementation because we dont have the information for these field they are set to NULL
		in the this function the hci_stack.hci_transport is setup. it returns an int err. ours return fine.

	back in the power control function * 1 is add to hcistack.num_cmd_packets. the comments says
	"assume that one cmd can be sent". 
	 hci_stack.state is set to HCI_STATE_INITIALIZING
	 hci_stack.state is set to 0
	 the switch breaks and an internal event is created. this is done with a call to hci_emit_state()

	 	hci_emit_state(): this function basically creates an event of size 4 bytes. it loads the first byte with BTSTACK_EVENT_STATE, the second with the size of the event and the third with the current state of the HCI. It send the packet to the HCI packet handler
	 
	back in the power control function the hci_run() is called

		hci_run(): this fucntion call the
